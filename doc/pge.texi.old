@chapter Obtaining PGE

You can download a copy PGE from
@uref{http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/pge/pge-@value{version-pge}.tar.gz}
and extract the archive contents.  Both the download and extraction
can be done from the command line:

@example
$ rm -f student-pge-@value{version-pge}.tar.gz
$ wget http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/pge/student-pge-@value{version-pge}.tar.gz
$ tar xvf student-pge-@value{version-pge}.tar.gz
@end example

@node Dependencies, Building, Obtaining, (dir)
@section Dependencies

PGE requires the following packages to be installed.  You do not need
to perform any of these commands if you are using PGE in a laboratory
at Glamorgan.

The GNU C compiler @file{gcc}, GNU Modula-2 @file{gm2}, GNU make
@file{make}, GNU binutils @file{binutils}, @file{x86-m2} and Bruce Evan's
assembler (@file{bin86}).

Assuming that you are on a Debian or Ubuntu based system you could
obtain @file{gm2} and @file{x86-m2} by adding these entries to
your @file{/etc/apt/sources.list}.

@example
#
#  GNU Modula-2 repo
#

deb http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/debian/ squeeze main
deb-src http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/debian/ squeeze main
@end example

Now they can be installed by using the following commands:

@example
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install bin86 libc6-dev-i386 gm2 gcc x86-m2
@end example

@node Building, Lab exercises, Dependencies, (dir)

You can configure PGE by:

@example
$ mkdir -p build-pge $HOME/opt
$ cd build-pge
$ ../student-pge-@value{version-pge}/configure --prefix=/usr
@end example

The above must be done if any change in
@file{student-pge-@value{version-pge}/Makefile.in} is made.  For example in
order to undertake the various lab exercises you will need to set the
@code{APPLICATION} variable inside @file{Makefile.in}.

It would be sensible to now check which directory you are in via:

@example
$ pwd
@end example

Write down the output of @code{pwd} as you will need to come back to
this directory next time to work on PGE.

To build PGE type:

@example
$ make
@end example

Once this compiles cleanly the PGE image needs to be placed onto a usb
memory stick.  Note that this will @strong{completely trash} the usb
memory stick!  You can reuse the memory stick of course - but it will
require reformatting.  Please use a spare memory stick and physically
mark it to avoid any mistakes!

To place the PGE image onto the usb memory stick you can either use an
Ubuntu client (in J204/J202/J208/J210) or if you are in J203 switch to
the console of the ltsp client.

The ltsp console can be activated by pressing @code{<alt><ctrl><f1>}.
You can switch back to the graphics mode via @code{<alt><f7>}.
Assuming you are now at the console on the ltsp client, login and
change to the correct directory.

@example
cd @file{build directory you wrote down}
make bootusb
@end example

Notice that you will need to modify your @file{build-pge/Makefile}
to reflect the usb device (most likely @file{/dev/sdb}).
Open up @file{build-pge/Makefile} in your favourite editor and
change the line:

@example
# set USBDEVICE to your usb device
#
USBDEVICE=/dev/rawusb
@end example

to

@example
# set USBDEVICE to your usb device
#
USBDEVICE=/dev/sdb
@end example

or the appropriate device.  You should be able to see the device by
typing the following at the command line:

@example
$ df -h
/dev/sdb      1424   1381    43  97% /media/foobar
@end example

which indicates the @file{/dev/sdb} is mounted onto @file{/media/foobar}.

You will be prompted to press enter to confirm that you are about to
trash the contents of the usb memory stick and then it will place PGE
onto the device.  Now find an unused computer in and place the usb
memory stick into the usb port and reboot the computer.  You should
see some bios diagnostics and then some messages saying the micro
kernel is coming to life.

@node Lab exercises, Licence, News, (dir)
@chapter Lab exercises

The lab exercises are found under @file{student-pge-@value{version-pge}/lab}.
For each lab exercise you will need to:

@table @code
@item (i)
modify @file{student-pge-@value{version-pge}/Makefile.in} to reflect the
exercise being undertaken.  This only needs to be done once.

@item (ii)
edit the appropriate file inside each lab directory and complete
the code.  Now you need to go through the edit, compile, build, run
cycle until the code is perfect!  Remember to @code{make bootdisk}
every time you want to test your code!

@end table

Each sub section below corresponds to a sub directory under
@file{student-pge-@value{version-pge}/lab}.
