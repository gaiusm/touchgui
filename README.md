# touchgui

is a simple touch based tile gui library which works on top of pygame.
It comes with creative commons assets from Kenney Vleugels (www.kenney.nl)
which work well with this library.  See the licence in the images directory.

The tile touch based gui library can create text based tiles, or image
tiles and the programmer can transform the images using a variety of
colour transformations which are then used to indicate pointer over
and activated states.  The gui allows the programmer to register
callbacks with tiles and detects double and single tap.  It also
provides polling select and blocking select and an interface to the
pygame event queue.

The programmer can group tiles into forms and select/activate all
tiles within a form.
