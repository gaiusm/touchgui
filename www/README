This directory contains the source files for the GNU Modula-2
homepage.  This is done as there is a strong relationship between the
information on the homepage and the GNU Modula-2 documentation
gm2/gm2.texi, NEWS file gm2/NEWS). It also allows encourages
collaborative web authoring. Nevertheless this directory does not
contain documentation, this is held in texinfo format in gm2/gm2.texi.
